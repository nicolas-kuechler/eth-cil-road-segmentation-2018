# CIL - Road Segmentation - 2018

Segmenting an image consists in partitioning an image into multiple segments (formally one has to assign a class label to each pixel). A simple baseline is to partition an image into a set of patches and classify every patch according to some simple features (average intensity). Although this can produce reasonable results for simple images, natural images typically require more complex procedures that reason abut the entire image or very large windows.
